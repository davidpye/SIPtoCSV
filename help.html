      <h1>SIP API CSV Exporter - Help</h1>
      <h2>What is this Application for?</h2>
      <p>This Application allows Hub Partners on the Unlocking Out Sound Heritage project to access the data they submitted to the British Library, by collecting the data from the BL's web APIs and converting it into standard CSV, using the Dublin Core archival format.</p>
      <p>An API is simply a way for one web-based application to speak to another. Allowing this application to collect the data for you, and automating the conversion process.</p>
      <h2>How to use this Application:</h2>
      <p>First of all you must make sure you are on a computer which has access to the BL's VPN for the USOSH project. If you are not connected this application will not work.</p>
      <p>Once connected to the VPN, also make sure you are logged into the SIP tool by visiting https://avsip.ad.bl.uk/ and inputting your user credentials.</p>
